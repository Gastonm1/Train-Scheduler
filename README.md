# Train-Scheduler

This is a Front-End Train Schedule Application

#Description
I use firebase to push and pull data from the database. This app will accept user input to add new train name, start time and frequency to schedule. Stores Train info in Firebase for data persistence and retrieves information from database on load. Schedules refresh every minute to reflect updated arrival information.
